# Tamara de Lempicka_website
Crappy website I realized using HTML & CSS for a university project. I made it about Tamara De Lempicka 'cause she was _a bit gay_ so we have something in common + I really appreciate her art. <br>
I've never made a website in my life, I barely knew HTML & CSS so even if it's an easy thing for most people, for me it was something new and I'm kinda satisfied of how it came out.

<ins>warning:</ins> probably a there's a shitton of things done in the worst possible way
